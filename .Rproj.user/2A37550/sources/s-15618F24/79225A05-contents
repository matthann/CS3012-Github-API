# 1 ----------------------- Visualisation of Data -----------------------

plot(cpimel)  # clear upward trend 
seasonplot(cpimel)    # default frequency of 4
plot(decompose(cpimel))     # decomposes observed data into seasonal, trend and random components
plot(diff(cpimel))
ggtsdisplay(cpimel)

# In looking at the graphs, there is an evident upward trend. In looking at the random components in the 
# decomposition, this represents the components of the overall trend that cannot be predicted. They have 
# no discernible pattern and are completely random. The seasonality component is minimal, but because it 
# is present, there is a slight seasonal trend in the data.
# If one plots the difference in values from the data, it is seen that the differences are relatively stationary.
# Even though there are a few strong cyces, they are acyclic and in the long-term are not predictable. 

# With the ACF, we are always comparing the CPI in one quarter, with all of the previous quarters. So it is useful 
# here, as the CPI between successive quarters does change, but usually not as much as it does from one year to the
# next. So, here, we would expect successive values to have a reasonable amount of correlation. This means that with
# each successive quarter in the cpimel data set, the correlations become less significant with previous values as
# time goes on.
# This PACF shows us that the most recent cpimel data point is the most relevant in deciding the next cpimel.
# It means that before the most recent cpimel data point, there's not actually a lot of information in the quarter's 
# before that to use. Thus, the most recent data point is the most relevant to use as it tells us the most information.

# Because there appears to be a seasonal component in the decomposition of the data, this would suggest that the 
# best predictive models in forecasting future values would be those that take seasonality into account. Thus, 
# based on visuals alone, we would expect to use either of the two Seasonal Holt Winters Algorithms. However, it 
# is best to choose the algorithm that results in the smallest value for the sum of squared errors.

# 2 ----------------------- Holt Winters Algorithms ---------------------

# SES uses only the smoothing constant, alpha. DES uses two smoothing constants, alpha and beta. Both
# Seasonal Holt Winters models use three smoothing constants: alpha, beta and gamma.
# Each model chooses their smoothing constants by choosing the smoothing constants that minimise their
# respective sum of squared errors. We would, at this stage, based on visuals, expect one of the two 
# Seasonal Holt Winters algorithms to result in the lowest value for SSE.

# Single Exponential Smoothing
HoltWinters(cpimel,beta=FALSE,gamma=FALSE)$SSE    # SSE = 115.0692
# The SSE is extremely large meaning that the forecast of future values is most likely unreliable. 
# This is confirmed by an unusual plot. 
plot(forecast(HoltWinters(cpimel,beta=FALSE,gamma=FALSE)))   

# Double Exponential Smoothing
HoltWinters(cpimel,gamma=FALSE)$SSE     # SSE = 28.26443
# This below plot is the most accurate of the four, as explained below.
plot(forecast(HoltWinters(cpimel,gamma=FALSE)))

# Seasonal Holt Winters: Additive - SHW+
HoltWinters(cpimel,seasonal="additive")$SSE      # SSE = 33.72781 
plot(forecast(HoltWinters(cpimel,seasonal="additive")))

# Season Holt Winters: Multiplicative - SHWx
HoltWinters(cpimel,seasonal="multiplicative")$SSE        # SSE = 34.57654
plot(forecast(HoltWinters(cpimel,seasonal="multiplicative")))

# The model for forecasting that should be used is the one which results in the lowest value for the sum of squared errors.
# In this case, it is double exponential smoothing. This is not what we expected from the visualisation, but clearly, the 
# overall trend and the random components are more important in this model than the seasonal element of the decomposition.
# This is likely because the seasonal component values are low, so their effects are almost negligible. 
# Hence, double exponential smoothing is the best algorithm used to forecast future values for this dataset. 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 3 -------------------- Best Selected Algorithm: DES -------------------

DES = forecast(HoltWinters(cpimel,gamma=FALSE), h=3)
plot(DES)
best = summary(DES)

# The above plot shows the forecasted values for the forecasted values predicted by double exponential smoothing.
# These forecasted values appear on the plot as a blue line with a surrounding grey area. The blue line represents
# the future forecasted values with 80% confidence while the grey area represents the future forecasted values 
# with 95% confidence.
# 'best' shows a summary table with info relating to the forecasted values as predicted by DES. This summary 
# contains the chosen values for the smoothing parameters, alpha and beta, future forecasted values and also,
# the confidence intervals associated with these future forecasted values.
# The plot and summary table would relate to one another in that their predicted values would be equal.

# 4 ----------------------- Meaning of the Results  ---------------------

# From the plot of cpimel, it is seen that there is an overall upward trend. Almost every quarter's CPI increased   
# over the previous quarter's value. One particular quarter does not appear to increase more so than any other quarter,
# as seen by the plot of diff(cpimel),
# Due to the fact that there is an overall upward trend, it would make sense for this overall trend to continue.
# This would result in expected future values that are all increasingly larger than the last datapoint in the
# cpimel dataset.
# In calculating the sum of squared errors for the 4 models - single exponential smoothing, double exponential smoothing 
# (DES), additive seasonal holt winters and multiplicative seasonal holt winters, DES resulted in the lowest value for 
# sum of squared errors (SSE). The value of the SSE for DES was chosen by using the values of alpha and beta that 
# minimised the SSE. The values for alpha and beta chosen, respectively, were: 0.8167533 and 0.4824598.
# In DES, alpha smooths the level component and beta smooths the trend component. The greater these values to 1, the 
# greater the influence of the most recent value. 
# Because DES resulted in the lowest SSE, its forecasted values are most reliable. These forecasted values are as 
# expected in that the overall upward trend continues. The DES forecasts are:
